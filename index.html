                        In February of 1979, Tehran was in chaos. A cancer-stricken Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the
                        Western-backed autocrat, had gone into exile in mid-January, leaving behind a rickety regency
                        council. On Feb. 1, Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the godfather of the revolution, returned
                        from exile in Paris. And in the Iranian version of “Ten Days That Shook the World,” street
                        demonstrations raged until the government collapsed on Feb. 11.

                        Green Wave of Iran also referred to as the Persian Awakening or Persian
                        Spring by the western media, refers to a political movement that arose after the 2009 Iranian
                        presidential election, in which protesters demanded the removal of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from
                        office.
                        <br>
                        Major protests would continue after the inauguration as well. Among the largest were protests
                        that
                        were held on Iranian holidays, such as Quds Day on 18 September, 13th of Aban on 4 November and
                        Iranian Students Day on 7 December. According to The Guardian, it was projected that more
                        than 500,000 people participated in the 2009 presidential election protest. According to the
                        Associated Press, it is speculated that the protests may be connected to the country's economy
                        and
                        corruption.

                        Another wave of protests occurred following these election protests across Iran in 2011.

                        A series of nationwide civil protests in Iran, sometimes known as Bloody November took place in
                        2019
                        and 2020. Initially caused by a 200% increase in fuel prices, they occurred as part
                        of the wider Iranian Democracy Movement, leading to calls for the overthrow of the government in
                        Iran and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

                        Amini's death resulted in a series of large-scale protests across the country which garnered
                        international attention, including a statement from the United Nations High Commissioner for
                        Refugees, putting a focus on violence against women in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
                        Several leaders, organizations, and celebrities around the world condemned the incident and
                        expressed solidarity with the protesters. The United States Department of the Treasury and
                        Canada imposed sanctions on the morality police and Iranian leaders in various security
                        organizations.

                        <br>
                        The government of Iran attempted to suppress the protests, shooting protesters with birdshot and
                        metal pellets, deploying tear gas and water cannons, blocking access to many apps including
                        Instagram and WhatsApp, and limiting internet accessibility to reduce protesters' ability to
                        organize. These may be the most severe internet restrictions in Iran since 2019, when the
                        internet
                        was shut down completely.

                        This uprising has united people across ethnic lines that used to divide us.
                        During the 2019 protests, there was no unity between Iranian Arabs, Turks, Kurds and so on.
                        This time, people chant slogans such as ‘From Tabriz to Sanandaj, from Tehran to Mashhad.’
                        This time people are more united and persistent. We hope for change. Maybe not right now but we
                        will
                        try our best to achievve this goal.
